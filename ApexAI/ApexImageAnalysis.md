## 🛠 **Advanced Usage Example**

```javascript
const imageUrl = 'path/to/local/image.png'; // URL or local path to the image
const prompt = 'What can you tell me about this image?';

const analysisResult = await ApexImageAnalyzer({ imgURL: imageUrl, prompt });
console.log(analysisResult); // JSON representation of the image analysis
```

## 📂 **Customization Options**

- **Image Source**: Can be an online URL or a local file path. Local paths must be relative to the main project directory. For URLs, the image is first converted to a Data URL.
- **API Key**: Optionally provide your own API key for Groq. If omitted, a default key is used.
- **Prompt**: Customize the prompt to direct the analysis according to your needs.

## 💡 **Note**

- **File Path Handling**: The `imgURL` parameter can be an HTTP/HTTPS URL or a local file path. If using a local path, ensure it's relative to your project's root directory. For URLs, the image is converted to a Data URL for analysis.

💬 **Pro Tip**: For best results, ensure the image is clear and high-quality. Groq’s models perform best with images that have good resolution and distinct content.
